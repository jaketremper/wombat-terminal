## What This Is

W.O.M.B.A.T. Terminal is an interactive planning and simulation tool designed to help communities think through resilient neighborhood communications during disasters and infrastructure outages.

It provides:

- Scenario-based emergency planning (hurricanes, extended outages, etc.)
- Mesh network and GMRS radio planning guidance
- Battery and solar power estimation
- Equipment inventory tracking
- Printable reference cards
- Local session saving and exporting
- Fully offline operation

Everything runs client-side in your browser.

## What This Is Not

- Not official emergency guidance  
- Not real-time communications software

## Why It Exists

During disasters, communications fail long before help arrives.  
This tool exists to help neighborhoods plan **before** they need to improvise under stress.

It is intentionally pragmatic, offline-first, and built to be shared easily — even from a USB stick.

---

## Philosophy

- Offline-first  
- Zero telemetry  
- No dependencies  
- Plain HTML + CSS + JavaScript  
- Works from the local file system  
- Encourages printed backups  

---

## Contributing

Pull requests welcome.

Please keep contributions:

- Dependency-free  
- Offline-compatible  
- Simple and readable  

Bug reports and improvements appreciated.
